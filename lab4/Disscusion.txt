1.	Strings of 0's and 1's with unequal numbers of 0's and 1's.

	This grammar has shift/reduce conflicts in I4,I5,I6, and I9. In each of these states, there is a combination of
	reduceable states and shiftable states. Since there are two different options, the parser will not know what to
	do and will require a tie breaking decision to complete. Thus, this is not an SLR grammar

2. 	Strings of 0's and 1's that are palindromes (the second half of the string is the reverse of the first half.)

	From the output for grammar2, we can see that there are shift/reduce conflicts in both states I3 and I4.
	This is becuase there are instance such as E->0.I0 and E->0. This will cause a problem were the system
	will not no whether the grammar was completed resulting in a reduction, or if one is continuing which
	requires a shift. Thus, this is not an SLF grammar

3.	Strings of 0's and 1's of the form xx

	Assuming that xx means combinations such as 001 001 or 110 110, this grammar can not be done. This is because
	the first production would need to be S->XX. X would then produce any combination of 1's and 0's, but there
	is no way of guarenteeing that the second X will produce an exact copy. Thus this is not a SLR grammar.
